The *activation* operator creates an [action](Actions.md) that activates one of three form elements:

-   Property - sets the focus on the specified [property](Properties.md) on the form.
-   Tab â€” selects one of the tabs in the specified [tab panel](Form_design.md#tab-broken).
-   Form - activates the specified [form](Forms.md), if open. If one form was opened several times, the one opened first is activated.

### Language

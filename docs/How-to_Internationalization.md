title: 'How-to: Internationalization'
---

The system supports  [internationalization](Internationalization.md) by passing to the client values localized according to the language chosen by the user. All values in braces are localized. Let's assume that we need to implement a simple form with a list of books and their prices that we can create/delete.

We will declare logic in the usual way, but instead of specifying names explicitly, we will be using IDs.


We will then create a new Resource Bundle and will save our Id values in different languages to it:

Let's call it **I18nResourceBundle** (the system will only read files ending in **ResourceBundle**) and choose the languages to be used:

After that, we define values for each Id in each of the selected languages:

Upon execution, all values, by default, will be shown in the server language (which, in turn, is defined by the Os language by default):

You can change the language and country settings for a particular user in their profile:

In this case, when the user logs in to the system again, everything will be shown in the selected language:

Ids can also be used in expressions:


Remember that such expressions cannot be used in [materializations](Materializations.md). 

The system cannot automatically localize user data. The developer is responsible for this.

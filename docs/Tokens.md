title: 'Tokens'
---

A *token* in a programming language is the smallest significant sequence of characters. In the **lsFusion **language tokens are keywords, [IDs](IDs.md), [literals](Literals.md) and special character sequences.

Tokens are usually separated by *delimiters* (spaces, line breaks, tabs), but separators can be omitted in cases where ambiguity does not occur.

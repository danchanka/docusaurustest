title: 'Loop (FOR)'
---

The *loop* operator creates an [action](Actions.md) that iterates all object collections for which the defined *condition* is met, and executes a defined action for each such object collection (let's call it the *main one).* You can also define an *alternative action* that will be executed only if no object collections have been found that meet the condition*.* The condition itself is defined as a certain [property](Properties.md). Let's say that the condition is *satisfied* if the value of this property is not **NULL**. 

By default, object collections are iterated in arbitrary order. However, the developer can explicitly define this order, if necessary. To do this, you need to specify a list of properties with values in an ascending or descending order that will define the order of object iteration.

As for other [set operations](Set_operations.md), the condition must be such that the operation is [correct](Set_operations.md#operation-correctness).

### Adding an object

This operator also allows you to create an object of a specified concrete [custom class](User_classes.md) for each iterated object collection. This object can then be used in the main action as a parameter.

### Language

The syntax of the loop operator is described by [the**FOR** operator](FOR_operator.md).

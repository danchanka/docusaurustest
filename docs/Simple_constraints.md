title: 'Simple constraints'
---

The platform currently supports four types of *simple constraints*: *consequence*, *exception*, *equality*, and *definiteness*. For all simple constraints, an *automatic resolution* mechanism is supported. When this is enabled, instead of throwing an error the platform itself restores system integrity.

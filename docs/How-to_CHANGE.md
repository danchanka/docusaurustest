##### Example 1

###### Task

We have a sales order for the books.

import {CodeSample} from './CodeSample.mdx'

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseAssign&block=sample1"/>

We need to create an action to place the order on 30 days from today and apply a 5% discount.

###### Solution

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseAssign&block=solution1"/>

##### Example 2

###### Task

Similar to **Example 1**, except that a specification was added to the order. The current price for each book is also defined.

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseAssign&block=sample2"/>

We need to create an action to populate all the lines in the order with current prices for the corresponding books.

###### Solution

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseAssign&block=solution2"/>

Make sure to use WHERE in the action. Otherwise, the prices will be set for all lines of all orders in the database.

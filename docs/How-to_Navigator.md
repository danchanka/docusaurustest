title: 'How-to: Navigator'

##### Example 1

###### Condition

We have the forms with a list of books and categories.


We need to add them to the [navigator](Navigator.md) to the new folder called **Application** under the main toolbar.

###### Solution


By specifying **WINDOW** for the **application** element, we indicated that all its child objects must be displayed in the system [window](Navigator_design.md) called **toolbar**. This will look like this:

##### Example 2

###### Condition

Similar to **Example 1**.

We need to place the same forms in the subfolder called Directories.

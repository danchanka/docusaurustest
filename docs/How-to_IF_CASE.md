##### Example 1

###### Condition

We have a list of books associated with certain categories. Each book is assigned a price.

import {CodeSample} from './CodeSample.mdx'

<CodeSample url="https://documentation.lsfusion.org/sample?file=UseCaseIfCase&block=sample1"/>

We need to create an action that sets a given price for books associated with the specific category and a fixed price for all other books. When no category is selected, the error message must appear.

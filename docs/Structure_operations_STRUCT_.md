The term *structure* is used in the platform to refer to the [classes](Classes.md) which objects consist of a collection of other objects in a fixed order. The platform supports two operators for working with structures:


Structures support comparison operations which are executed sequentially for each object included in the structure.

To create a property that returns an object from the structure the [**\[ \]** operator](Operator_.md) is used.

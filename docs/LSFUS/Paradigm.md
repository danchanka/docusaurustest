# Paradigm

The paradigm can be divided into two parts:

[Logical model](Logical_model.md)

Describes the system's immediate functionality, i.e. what the system knows how to do, what data it takes as input, and what data it returns.

Physical model

It includes everything else -Â everything related to the development, performance improvement and management of a working system.

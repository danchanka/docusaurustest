# Extensions

*Extension* is a technique that allows a developer to extend the functionality of one module in another. 

The **lsFusion** platform supports extension of [classes](lsFusionClass_extension.md), [properties](lsFusionProperty_extension.md), [actions](lsFusionAction_extension.md) and [forms](lsFusionForm_extension.md). All the described mechanisms can also be used within a single module in order to change the initialization order of system elements. 

It is worth noting that almost all other platform constructs (for example, the [navigator](lsFusionNavigator.md) or [shape design](lsFusionForm_design.md)) are extensible by definition, so there is no separate extension logic for them.

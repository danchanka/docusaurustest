title: 'Eval (EVAL)'
---

The eval operator creates an action that executes defined program code in the **lsFusion** language. Program code is defined as a property whose value should belong to the string class. This is implemented using an [action](Actions.md) which takes a line of code as an argument.

The code that is passed to an action must be a sequence of [instructions](Instructions.md). It is assumed that one of these instructions will create an action named **run** (it is this action that will be executed).

**Action execution**

This operator can also execute a single action (rather than a set of instructions): in this case the code should be a sequence of [action operators](Оperators.md) and local property declarations. To refer to the parameters of the action, you can use the special character $ and the parameter number (starting from 1).

**Executable code restrictions**

In the current implementation, executable code must not contain instructions that modify existing objects in the system. For example, you cannot add [events](Events.md) or [data](Data_properties_DATA_.md) and materialized properties, [extend](Extensions.md) existing objects, etc.

**Language**

To declare an action that executes program code, use the [**EVAL** operator](EVAL_operator.md).

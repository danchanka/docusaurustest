-   Property - sets the focus on the specified [property](lsFusionProperties.md) on the form.
-   Tab â€” selects one of the tabs in the specified [tab panel](Form-design_29884443.html#Formdesign-tab).
-   Form - activates the specified [form](lsFusionForms.md), if open. If one form was opened several times, the one opened first is activated.

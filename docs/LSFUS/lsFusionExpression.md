# Expression

An *expression* is a combination of [property operators](lsFusionProperty_operators.md) and [parameters](lsFusionProperties.md). When an expression is evaluated sequentially in [priority](lsFusionOperator_priority.md)Â  order, all the operators are executed.

The result of that execution will be either a [property](lsFusionProperties.md) or a parameter (in the case of single-parameter expression). Their value shall be called the *value* of the expression.

An expression can be described by the following set of recursive rules:

# Class extension

The class [extension](lsFusionExtensions.md) technique allows the developer to *inherit* one [class](lsFusionClasses.md) from another after its creation. Also, using this mechanism you can add extra [static objects](lsFusionStatic_objects.md) to a class.

Class extension, together with the [property](lsFusionProperty_extension.md) and [action extension](lsFusionAction_extension.md) technique, allows you to:

-   Extract the relations between classes into a separate module, thereby obtaining a more modular architecture.
-   Modify the functionality of an existing module without making any changes to it.
-   Declare classes in the [metacode](lsFusionMetaprogramming.md) by defining the inheritance of a class outside its bounds.

**Language**

To extend a class, use the [**EXTEND CLASS** instruction](lsFusionEXTEND_CLASS_instruction.md).

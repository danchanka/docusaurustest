title: 'Cancel changes (CANCEL)'
---

The *cancel changes* operator completely clears the current [change session](Change_sessions.md).

As with other session management operators, you can explicitly specifyÂ [nested local properties](Session-management_30769221.html#Sessionmanagement-nested) for the cancel operator.

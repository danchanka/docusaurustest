# lsFusionInterruption (BREAK)

# Interruption (BREAK)

The *interrupt operator* creates an [action](lsFusionActions.md) that exits the most nested loop ([normal](lsFusionLoop_FOR_.md) or [recursive](lsFusionRecursive_loop_WHILE_.md)) within which this action is located. Control is transferred to the first action following the loop. If the created action is not inside a loop, its behavior becomes similar to the action created by the [exit operator](lsFusionExit_RETURN_.md). 

**Language**

The interrupt operator syntax is described by the [**BREAK** operator](lsFusionBREAK_operator.md).

# Modularity

Modularity is a key mechanism for providing extensibility, reusability, and effective interaction among the development team.

Any [project](lsFusionProjects.md) developed on the **lsFusion** platform consists of a set of [modules](lsFusionModules.md), each of which implements a particular system functionality. Any module can extend the functionality of the modules on which it [depends](Modules_1146882.html#Modules-depends) using the special [extensions](lsFusionExtensions.md) method.

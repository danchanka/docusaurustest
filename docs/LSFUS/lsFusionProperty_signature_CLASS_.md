# lsFusionProperty signature (CLASS)

# Property signature (CLASS)

The signature operator creates a [property](lsFusionProperties.md) which determines whether, in terms of [classes](lsFusionClasses.md), a specified property can have a non-**NULL** value for the arguments passedÂ or not. In fact, this operator deduces possible classes of a given property from its semantics, after which it uses [logical](lsFusionLogical_operators_AND_OR_NOT_XOR_.md) operators and the [classification](lsFusionClassification_IS_AS_.md) operator to create the required property.

**Language**

To implement this operator, use the [**CLASS** operator](lsFusionCLASS_operator.md).

To create an [action](lsFusionActions.md) that performs a sequence of other actions, the [**{...}** operator](lsFusionOperator_..._.md) is used - a block enclosed by curly brackets. The body of this block must contain a sequence of [action operators](lsFusionОperators.md) and local property declarations.

The term *structure* is used in the platform to refer to the [classes](Classes.md) which objects consist of a collection of other objects in a fixed order. The platform supports two operators for working with structures:

[table was removed]

Structures support comparison operations which are executed sequentially for each object included in the structure.

### Language

To create a property that creates a structure the [**STRUCT** operator](STRUCT_operator.md) is used.

To create a property that returns an object from the structure the [**\[ \]** operator](Operator.md) is used.

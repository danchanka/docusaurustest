title: 'How-to: GROUP CONCAT'
---

##### Example 1

###### Condition

We have a set of books associated with certain priority tags.

import {CodeSample} from './CodeSample.mdx'

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseConcat&block=sample1"/>

We need to retrieve a list of book tags separated by commas in alphabetical order.

###### Solution

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseConcat&block=solution1"/>

It is recommended that you specify the sizes of all the properties created using **GROUP CONCAT** that will be visible on a form. By default, the system implements the "pessimistic" scenario and reserves a lot of space for such properties.

##### Example 2

###### Condition

We have a set of books associated with certain categories and authors.

<CodeSample url="http://documentation.lsfusion.org:5000/sample?file=UseCaseConcat&block=sample2"/>

We need to retrieve a list of all authors by category separated by commas in descending order of the number of books.

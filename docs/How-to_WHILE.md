##### Example 1

###### Condition

We have an order for which a date is defined.


We need to display a message containing the number of orders for each date from a given interval.

###### Solution


Both these options will provide the same result.

The **sum** property defined in the **Time** system [module](Modules.md) is used to add one day to the given date.

##### Example 2

###### Condition

Similar to **Example 1**. We have also defined order lines, so that each line contains the (full) amount and the discount.


We need to create an action that "distributes" given discount by line, starting from the line with the largest amount.

###### Solution


##### Example 3

###### Condition

The logic for changing the balance for the book is defined as follows:


We need to create an action that will calculate the accumulated (integral) balance for a given time period.

###### Solution

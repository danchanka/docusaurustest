##### Example 1

###### Condition

We have the orders and their specification lines.


We need to create a form with a list of orders where the user can add, edit or delete them.

###### Solution


We do not add a link to the order for the line object on the *order* form, since when adding the object using *NEW*, the system will automatically set up this link based on the *FILTERS* block.

##### Example 2

###### Condition

Similar to Example 1.

We need to add order specification to the order list form.

###### Solution


It may be convenient that the user can view the order contents without editing it.

title: 'How-to: Property extension'

The classic approach for implementing polymorphism can look as follows:

Let's create an abstract class **Shape** with an abstract property **square**:


Now, let's create classes **Rectangle **and **Circle** inherited from **Shape**:


Define the implementation of the abstract property **square ** for the created classes:


Let's assume that we need to make it so that in certain cases we can override the method of calculating the area for the **Circle** class. In this case, we can use an abstract property, whose implementation can be changed in a different module, to add a kind of "entry point" to the line defining the implementation of area for a circle :


If the **overSquareCircle** property is not implemented in any module, its value will always be **NULL** and the base area calculation mechanism will be used. To change the calculation method to be used, you can define a different implementation in a certain **MyShape** module.


Note that you can use any other expressions instead of the [OVERRIDE operator](OVERRIDE_operator.md). In particular, [(+) and (-)](Arithmetic_operators_+_-_..._.md) may be the most frequently used operators.

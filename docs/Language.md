*lsFusion* is a programming language that describes **lsFusion** [modules](Modules.md).

Each module consists of a sequence of [instructions](Instructions.md) divided into module [header](Module_header.md) and *body*. The header may include four special instructions: **MODULE**, **REQUIRE**, **PRIORITY** and **NAMESPACE**, which define module parameters. The header is followed by the module *body* which consists of the remaining instructions and describes the logic of this module.

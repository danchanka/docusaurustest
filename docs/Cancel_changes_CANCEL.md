title: 'Cancel changes (CANCEL)'
---

The *cancel changes* operator completely clears the current [change session](Change_sessions.md).

As with other session management operators, you can explicitly specify [nested local properties](Session_management.md#nested-local-properties) for the cancel operator.

### Language
